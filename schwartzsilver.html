        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>The main design goal of this project was the find a way to balance images and text within a set of diverse and interesting layouts. Each page has a different layout that was, in some capacity, inspired by the building that rests on the page. Each
          spread plays with a horizontal layout in order to create a visual flow that changes from page to page. The book had to be designed by spread because of the fold out awards and profile tabs, which are incorporated at two points in the booklet.
          The purpose of these tabs is to make a space for listed information, such as the awards received by the company, to keep them from interrupting the flow of the main spreads. The center spread is dedicated to giving some brief information about
          the staff, which provides a break from the abundance of images present in the rest of the book. The book utilizes the same typeface as the company’s logo, as well as the same colors. The text blurbs about each structure are kept small and unintrusive
          so they don’t detract from the images of the company’s work.</p>
