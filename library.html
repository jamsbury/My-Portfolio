        <h6>project objective</h6>
        <p>Inform EWU students and faculty of JFK library services</p>
        <h6>target audience</h6>
        <p>EWU students and faculty (primary), students that would find the library services useful: VCD students, film students, math and science students.</p>
        <h6>audience needs</h6>
        <p>Clear language and purpose, visually appealing resources, relevant information in relevant locations, some form of directions in order for the viewer to reach each service.</p>
        <h6>deliverables</h6>
        <p>A set of 2:3 posters.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="text">
        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>These posters were created to improve the existing library posters, which were mostly made with images taken from Google or clip art. I made it a goal to make the projects stand out from the rest of the printed materials in the library by making
          them in a stark modern style, utilizing bright colors and bold typography. Because of this design decision, the posters have a much differerent styles from the others in the library. Each poster has the information needed to find each service.
          These posters are the result of several stylistic iterations, since the content (information) was relatively simple to write. I considered several ways to make the posters stand out among the overcrowded walls of the library, but I found that
          many of them just blended in with the large amount of both student and library related peices. I decided to make posters that were so different from everything that would be displayed around them that they would be attention grabbing without
          the need for humor that would become outdated in a few months or absurd imagery</p>
