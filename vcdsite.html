        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>This project was created solve a clear issue with Eastern Washington University's design program: it doesn't have an independent website and the pages that exist for it on EWU's official site are not very appealing, especially for a design program.
          To remedy this issue, I set out to create a centralized location where the department could share all the information and news they need to with both current and incoming students. Based on survey research, this included things like courses,
          professor information, and recent news (both university and VCD club related). While prospective students will like that the program is transparent about its classes and staff, they will be more interested in seeing the results of the program
          through a senior showcase section. University of Washington does this, which is what I based on the showcase section on. It draws a lot of attention to their program and EWU would benefit from something similar. This would also give graduating
          seniors the opportunity to show their work and draw attention to their portfolios. The mockup of the website was created in Sketch and pushed to InVision through Craft Manager, a Sketch extension that links the two. My process primarily consisted
          of content focused prototypes, sketching, construction, and then testing. </p>

    <h6 class="casetitle">what does vcd stand for?<br><span>ewu 'visual communication design' program website</span></h6>

    <p>This VCD club website acts as a solution for the Eastern’s design program’s current problem of not having an effective way to convey program information. This is something that is common among other universities and serves a clear purpose. I combined
      the primary “information” aspect of the project with a section meant to showcase senior student work, which will help draw in new students. The showcase section shows the “results” of the program to potential students. It also serves the purpose
      of advertising graduates to employers and helps bring attention to their individual portfolio websites. It is harder to EWU to bring prospective students into the design program because it is directly competing with the other schools that do create
      showcase sites. Because it is a design program the site itself obviously needs to be well designed and visually appealing. For the website to be beneficial, it needed to contain general information on the program, such a degree information and information
      on specific classes so that incoming students and their parents can get an idea of what to expect from the program.</p>

    <p class="byline">University of Washington Portfolio Site SWOT</p>

    <p>To begin the project, I researched competitor websites that serve a similar purpose to the one I was going to mock up. I ran a SWOT analysis of the University of Washington's senior portfolio website. I examined both UW’s main design program site
      as well as their independent showcase website for 2018’s graduating class. Their “main” site is bundled with the art and art history programs. I then moved on to creating a content-focused wireframe, the goal was to get an idea of what should be
      on the page and what it’s information hierarchy should be within regard to the visual aspect of the website. The content focused of the wireframe allowed me to get an idea of what the core content of the site was without getting bogged down in how
      I was going to present it. There were some on-the-fly adjustments made the content of the layouts later in the process that diverged from this plan. The elements of each page were ordered by importance, so their location on the spreadsheet also
      tended to dictate where they were placed on the actual layout of the website once I began the basic wireframing stage.</p>

    <p class="byline">Content Wireframe for Landing Page</p>

    <p>The text wireframes were than adapted to a more graphical layout, which was wired up to an interactive prototype. I had a prototype for mobile and for desktop versions, although it sadly isn’t this easy during the actual building of the website. This
      is the point in the process where I began to consider layout. In general, my layouts were created by “remixing” elements from numerous other sites as well as general UI features. Because I wanted to leave room to add larger graphical illustrations
      and patterns to the final prototype, I left some room for them in the wireframe. There are separate wireframes for mobile and for desktop, although they are meant to display the same general content. At this point in the process, I found that I
      had some difficulty figuring out how to layout the large amount of information since it would inevitably create a long, scrolling page and that introduces some additional navigational challenges that needed to be addressed. To help compensate for
      this, I attempted to stick to relatively simple UI patterns. </p>

    <p class="byline">Basic Wireframing</p>

    <p>I chose to develop two “style tiles” sets with different color palettes, typefaces, and art styles to decide how I was going to populate these graphical wireframes. I then presented them to my peers, who made a judgement about which style I should
      base my designs on. The first style tile was created with a color palette based around EWU’s primary red color. I took a complimentary cyan color, a muted cyan and orange and attempted to develop a color palette out of that. The inspiration is focused
      on geometric illustrations and photographic elements. Typefaces for the tile were Futura and Gills Sans. The second style tile uses a standard CMYK color palette with more typographic experimentation in the inspiration images. The typefaces for
      this tile were Perpetua Bold Franklin Gothic Book. My peers told me to use the typefaces and color palette of Tile 2 with the inspiration images of Tile 1.</p>

    <p class="byline">Style Tiles / Mood Boards</p>

    <p>Once I started really working on the high-fidelity prototypes, I began to draw more inspiration from the CMYK color palette, to the point where the site began to take on the appearance of printed material with printing marks. This was an interesting
      art direction; I’ve never seen it before on the web, so I decided to lean into it and let that aesthetic move the project forward. It also creates an interesting tension between the web and print medium. I added some details in the spirit of this
      concept that both add meta data to the site while expanding on the look, such as the fake file names for the images on the site. I had some troubles with the interaction between Sketch and InVision during this project as it was one of the first
      times I had attempted to use the Craft Manager plugin to link the two together, but I managed to achieve everything I needed to do to complete the prototype. There were a couple of minor adjustments made to the original layout concepts for the sake
      of design clarity or to match the visual theme of the site. I did some sketching to develop an intro banner to the website, which acts as a more visual interesting header than just plain type. There were several phases to this, as well as several
      sketched concepts. Some of these sketches were sharply geometric, like the style tiles would have originally suggested, I eventually decided on a sketch that incorporated a “spilled liquid” look that called back to the ink of the printing process,
      although most printer ink isn’t exactly a liquid anymore. I enjoyed the way it looked and continued to refine the concept until it reminded me of a lava lamp. This was what I went on to develop into a digital file.</p>

    <p class="byline">Bubbling VCD Typography</p>

    <p>The bubbly, psychedelia influenced lettering was developed as a result of peer feedback about the first iteration of the landing page header, which used a simple header in plain type over the liquid color splash. I was told to render the type in a
      style that matched the flowing liquid feeling I was already using or to find a more unique way to render the typography. I had considered typesetting the title of the page so that each word was partially overlapped by one of the color waves, but
      I didn’t like the way that looked and felt like it hampered legibility more than necessary. What I found is that the bubbly lettering, while making the header slightly harder to read, also makes it more interesting than the use of a normal typeface.
      However, this is harder to scale onto mobile screens. Because of this, the words had to be re-arranged to fit the screen resolution of mobile devices, and that also played a factor in how the lettering turned out. If the site was to be created,
      each letter or word would most likely be an independent .svg file so that they could be easily moved through CSS media queries.</p>

    <p>Overall, I really enjoyed creating this project because of the creative freedom I was provided for it. There are a few things that I might have done differently if I were to do the project again, or to adapt it to a fully functional website, but I’m
      quite happy with where it ended up even though I wasn’t able to figure out how to emulate a few common web features within Sketch and InVision, which caused me to make a few compromises that wouldn’t be necessary if the site was coded. I learned
      quite a bit about prototyping in InVision and I enjoyed getting some more hands-on time with InVision’s settings. There’s a lot of great hidden features in InVision that surprised me, especially since it’s a web app. Looking back on it, one thing
      that I found interesting about this project is how the visual style evolved over time into what it eventually became. I hadn’t planned on it becoming a printer mark inspired project, but the VCDC logo caused me to suggest CMYK as one of my color
      palettes and I pulled a lot more inspiration than I was expecting from that train of thought.
