        <h6>project objective</h6>
        <p>Create a themed photobook centered around antiques photographed in Spokane antique stores. The book recontextualizes these items by isolating them using the medium of photography, forcing us to look at them more closely. </p>
        <h6>target audience</h6>
        <p>Photographers and other visual artists. Passion project.</p>
        <h6>audience needs</h6>
        <p>Book that feels good in hand and has a logical flow, well shot, edited, printed images.</p>
        <h6>deliverables</h6>
        <p>A post-bound photobook.</p>
        <h6>my role</h6>
        <p>Solo project, photography and production focus.</p>

        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>
          For the project, I took hundreds of pictures at various locations using a Canon T6i and a large tripod. I used a wide-angle lens in order to get close-up shots without risking knocking things over in the cluttered shops. I edited the photos using Lightroom
          Classic and Photoshop. I then created a layout of the images InDesign, where I laid out the text with the images and made marks on every page that acted as guides for my hole punching efforts. I then laid out the PDF spreads in a photoshop document
          and printed them on a large format printer. I cut out the individual spreads and punched holes in them using a hand-held hold punch device and pushed my post bindings through the holes. Because the spreads were printed on a large format printer
          they could not be printed to double sided. To resolve this issue, which was one of the largest challenges of this project, I had made sure that the book could be put together by folding each of the spreads in half. This caused the elbow of the
          folds to face outwards and be the edge that the reader holds when they flip through the book. This makes the paper feel much thicker than it is. While creating this project I was influenced by the photobook <i>Red Empty</i> by Carl
          Michael von Hausswolff, a monochromatic photobook about recontextualizing abandoned locations. Instead of abandoned and decaying locations, I studied abandoned and forgotten objects.

    <p>I walked into the antique store and was greeted by an old man. He seemed to be hard of hearing but was quite friendly. I asked him if I could photograph some of the merchandise in his store, to which he kindly replied “of course!” It was one of many
      stores I had visited, but this one stood out. The outside of the store front was covered in posters about everything being for sale. The store was closing, everything had to go or was going to get discarded, I assume.</P>

    <a href="img/luflic/sode-bottles.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/sode-bottles.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Old Soda Bottles"></a>

    <p>The interior of the store was covered in signs as well, sprawled across the walls and over the hoardings of paintings. They were taped on shelves, door frames, tables, busts, just about anything you could see had been marked in some way. I attached
      the lens to my camera, deployed my tripod, screwed my camera on and pulled the lens cap off. As I searched for my first object of interest, I took note of the general atmosphere of the store. Music was playing through a set of old speakers mounted
      in the corners of all the rooms, the music crackled. They were probably antique, too. The distortion of the speakers gave the dance band and classical works a haunting feel, but it was comforting in a way. It was genuine.</p>

    <a href="img/luflic/china-wall.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/china-wall.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Fine China Wall"></a>

    <p>Photography has the power to draw our eyes to new things, to recontextualize the sights of the everyday world. To deliver to us a view that we would not have normally seen otherwise, even if it were placed directly in front of us. Photography has
      the power to freeze a subject at a specific place and time in its story. The world of forgotten antiques makes a perfect subject, then. They represent long forgotten stories of forgotten people, specters who once displayed these objects in their
      homes or used them as tools. These are objects of affect, their rust and wear reveal to us parts of their history. From glass birds to rusted bottle openers, each of these objects was created with a purpose in mind. Some are no longer suitable for
      their original uses, either from age or disrepair.</p>

    <a href="img/luflic/book.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/book.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Empty record keeping book."></a>

    <p>These objects can also reveal to us parts of our culture, what we once valued, what we once saw as acceptable. Some of these objects are strange, perhaps even offensive by modern standards. Time flows around these junk objects, eroding away their
      original significance and leaving behind an “antique.” Objects forgotten, taken out of their contexts and placed next to each other. Assorted by vague descriptors like size, color, time period, or perhaps not at all. This association is the reason
      that this work needed to be bound in a photobook; these objects are linked in many ways. They have many things in common: location, age, lack of purpose, and the fact that they were photographed by me. </p>

    <a href="img/luflic/classical-bust.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/classical-bust.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Classical Bust"></a>

    <p>Looking closely, one can see the hidden details of these objects that the eye misses, they are cropped and isolated by the lens of camera lens in order to draw out the details that make up the objects. In this way, cameras do not only record objects,
      but also facilitate our understanding of them. It isolates not only the objects, but the specters that once possessed them. Looking upon these objects with modern eyes through the literal and metaphorical lens of modern equipment can show use truths
      about those who came before us and what they valued; even these “junk” objects are intricately crafted.</p>

    <a href="img/luflic/miniscope.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/miniscope.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Miniscope"></a>

    <p>Mirrors are decorated with ornate metal borders, animals are rendered in a still-life pose by expert glass workers, and expressive wood carvings paint a tale of despair. They tell the story of a society obsessed with excess, one in which craftsmanship
      is so common that it loses its value. These artifacts are rarely purchased once they find themselves within the walls of an antique store, for they have not moved into a store; they have been placed into a museum. They wait for us to visit and observe
      them, to wonder about their origins, to admire their craftsmanship, but rarely to carry home either due to their lack of use cases or their price (usually both).</p>

    <a href="img/luflic/phones.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/luflic/phones.jpg" alt="Luflic Artifacts: Telephone"></a>

    <p>These items weave a tragic narrative of purpose lost, they carry with them a melancholic aura that signifies the consequences of materialism and our fascination with age and ruin. The photo captures these emotions in a way that the human eye cannot
      and shows us things that we cannot see when looking at these objects behind glass or on display shelves. These items needed to be photographed in order to tell their full stories, a field trip to their current residence would not invoke the same
      significance or focus. Worse yet, it is a very real possibility that these objects will disappear down the river of time to their next, and perhaps final, resting places, never to be seen again. Their magic lost forever in the process. For these
      artefacts, each moment can be a decisive one, their last chance at true preservation. And so, they put on a beautiful, cluttered, melancholic show to the tunes emanating from a set of aged, crackling speakers playing worn vinyl records that echo
      throughout their space.</p>
