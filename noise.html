        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>The primary objective of this project is to introduce music listeners to an abrasive and challenging form of music using a visually dynamic and short book. Writing the content was one of the biggest challenges presented in this project, but the
          intimacy that this process created helped me understand how to design and present the material better. I wanted to maintain some level of consistency throughout the entire book while finding ways to surprise the reader upon every page turn.
          Since typography and lettering were the primary skills being developed by the project I spent a lot of time sketching, drafting, and vectorizing the letters that are presented so boldly on almost every other page. Each letter went through several
          dozen sketches as well as numerous defined drafts and digital iterations. The order of the book (and therefore the lettering) was decided by the general accessibility of each artist, from easiest to the most challenging. there was a good deal
          of adjustments made this during the production of the book because I found that many readers wanted to jump straight to the content at the back of the book. Because of this I decided to add more challenging music and place it closer to the front.
          Each letter was designed to reflect the artist or album it represents in some way, sometimes through linework and sometimes through general shape.</p>
