      <h6 id="project" class="casetitle">the project</h6>
      <p>
        You have hired STS DESIGN to complete a specific project or task, as
        agreed upon in your proposal of services document. The proposed cost of
        the project only includes the services outlined within that document,
        and nothing more. If you would like us to expand on your project with
        additional services or features or otherwise expand the scope,
        additional costs will be involved. Minor adjustments to existing
        content, layout, color, and/or functionality that is completed before
        the final sign off of the project are included and will not incur any
        additional costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making major changes (changing the scope of a project) early in the
        project will cost you less. The actual cost will depend on the project
        and the intensity of the changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each unsigned Proposal of Services Document is valid for 30 days after
        it is received. If the document has not been approved within that time
        period, there will need to be a new proposal.
      </p>

      <h6 id="revisions" class="casetitle">revisions</h6>
      <p>
        Revisions are the amount of major adjustments we will make to a project
        prior to the sign-off. For instance, a meeting over a draft of your
        website that leads to a set of layout or functionality changes would
        qualify as a revision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your proposal of services document will state how many additional
        revisions your project or milestone is allowed. Any revisions that are
        requested past those detailed in the proposal of service document count
        as a change of scope for the project and will incur a change order fee
        based on the type of changes.
      </p>

      <h6 id="time" class="casetitle">time frame</h6>
      <p>
        The time frame of your project is outlined in your proposal of services
        document. The time frames given are rough estimates based on our
        previous experience, current workload, the complexity of the project,
        and material availability. It also assumes that our communication is
        consistent and any process documents are approved within 5 business
        days.
      </p>

      <p>
        We keep an active queue of work and do not begin work on a project until
        the initial payment has been received. We make it our goal to start each
        project as soon as possible, and we will not begin work on a project
        until we can give it our full attention.
      </p>

      <h6 id="archival" class="casetitle">archival & continuation fees</h6>
      <p>
        Delayment typically arises during review periods, while we wait on
        content, materials, approvals, or payments. If it takes more than two
        weeks for us to hear back from the client, the project will be
        considered delayed. By delaying a project, we temporarily halt all work
        until contact is restored with the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a project is delayed for more than half of its estimated time frame
        (small projects) or half of the time frame of the milestone (large
        projects) we will archive it and require a continuation fee to place it
        back in our queue.
      </p>

      <p>
        The continuation fee of a project will be 15% of the total cost outlined
        in the Proposal of Services Document, up to a cap of $400 USD.
      </p>

      <h6 id="payments" class="casetitle">payments and milestones</h6>
      <p>
        The exact terms of payment are outlined in your proposal of services
        document. Typically, we require a 50% down-payment in order for us to
        place a project in our queue of work. In the case of larger projects, we
        might collect payments at specific milestones laid out in the proposal
        of services document. Once our team reaches a milestone your project
        will not move forward until we receive the payment to move forward.
        These milestone payments act as a sign-off to the completed milestone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our milestones are ordered so that the most important material is
        completed first. If you request changes to milestone 1 materials while
        we are working on milestone 3, you will incur a change order fee. Please
        ensure that you are confident with the work you receive before giving us
        the final sign-off on it.
      </p>

      <h6 id="meetings" class="casetitle">meetings</h6>
      <p>
        We will attempt to schedule meetings with you at various points
        throughout your project. The amount of meetings will depend on the
        length and complexity of the project. Meetings will typically be
        scheduled via email or by phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you require your meeting to be rescheduled, we will be flexible.
        However, please provide us with at least 24 hours notice if you require
        us to reschedule a meeting. Should you miss a meeting or provide us with
        notice on the same day you may be subject to a missed meeting fee that
        correlates with our hourly rate of $32 USD.
      </p>

      <h6 id="cancellations" class="casetitle">refunds and cancellations</h6>
      <p>
        If you wish to cancel the project after this agreement and the proposal
        of services have been executed, you will be refunded the deposit of the
        project minus the cost of any time that our team has spent on the
        project. For instance, if we spent 10 hours on the development of a
        website those 10 hours would not be refundable upon cancellation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon the cancellation of the project, we will cease work and you will
        not be held to any future milestone payments.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you wish to cancel the project and remove your website from our
        hosting, we require a 30 days notice to remove your information from our
        server and close out your account. Additional transfer fees may apply to
        transfer your hosting services. You will still pay the monthly hosting
        fee for the final month, and after the 30 days and completed hosting
        transfer, there will be no additional charges added to your account.
      </p>

      <h6 id="changes" class="casetitle">changes after launch</h6>
      <p>
        We are happy to help you with changes to your site after launch!
        However, any changes or modifications that were not included in the
        original proposal of service document will incur our hourly rate for
        completion. Hourly rate is $32 USD.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are utilizing one of the continued support plans - which are
        outlined in your proposal of services document - you will receive those
        hours of work per month for adjustments, changes, bug fixes, and
        expansions. These hours are non-transferable and expire at the end of
        each billing cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        In either case, work that expands the scope of the original project
        document, such as adding additional functionality, will require a new
        services document and will be treated as an additional project. This
        also applies to changes and adjustments that will take our team more
        than your support plan’s allotted hours to complete.
      </p>

      <h6 id="ip" class="casetitle">intellectual property</h6>

      <p>
        You will own the content that STS DESIGN, LLC creates as they are
        displayed on your website, social media, prints, or other documents. If
        you need the high resolution versions of the images or the working
        files, additional licensing may be required. We will work with you to
        decide the pricing and terms of further licensing based on the scope of
        the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purposes of this agreement, working files means RAW images,
        Adobe Photoshop files, Adobe Illustrator files, Adobe InDesign files,
        Adobe After Effects files, Adobe Premiere files, and uncompressed web
        images.
      </p>

      <p>
        You own your websites and are free to take the files and host them on
        your own services if requested.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we utilize images or other content that we did not create (such as
        stock photos), it has been licensed for use on your site or web app by a
        third party. That third party will retain ownership of the content in
        question according to their own terms and conditions. In the case of a
        stock photo, we may pay for the license to use the photo on your website
        but neither of us own the image. If you have additional questions about
        licensing- please ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the process of creating a website, we will create snippets of
        code and functionality. This work is used on your web site, but we
        retain ownership of these as our intellectual property so that we can
        reserve the right to use them on future projects as needed. The re-use
        of code and other elements help us speed up our processes and work more
        effectively and is standard practice.
      </p>

      <h6 id="hosting" class="casetitle">website hosting</h6>
      <p>
        The pricing in our proposal of services document always assumes that we
        will be the hosts of your project unless you requested otherwise. Our
        server is optimized for our workflow and we have full control of it. If
        you wish for us to use a different service, your project may incur an
        additional surcharge since it will require a change in our workflow.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you elect to choose your own host, we cannot be held responsible for
        the speed, security, performance, or uptime of your site. Fixing any
        problems related to hosting will also be billed at our hourly rate of
        $32 USD. If you decide to transfer hosting - either from our hosting
        plan to your own, or from your own to ours - additional transfer fees
        may apply depending on the complexity of the transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use reasonable efforts to make sure that your site will be available
        99.9% of the time during a monthly billing cycle. If we fail to meet
        that standard, you will be eligible to receive credit that will apply to
        future billing cycles based on the period of disruption. For the
        purposes of this agreement, disruption is defined as your site being
        unresponsive or returning server errors on valid user requests for more
        than 60 seconds of consecutive requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unavailability for scheduled server maintenance is excluded from these
        conditions. We will announce major maintenance events in advance.
        Service credits must be requested within seven days of the
        unavailability occuring.
      </p>

      <h6 id="photography" class="casetitle">photography</h6>
      <p>
        You own the photo content produced by STS DESIGN, LLC as described
        above, and may use it for whatever purposes you like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scheduling for photo shoots will be done in advance through email, by
        phone, or during a project’s launch meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you require your photoshoot to be rescheduled, we will attempt to be
        flexible. However, please provide us with at least 24 hours notice if
        you require us to reschedule a photoshoot. This will allow us to adjust
        our schedule for maximum efficiency. Should you not be prepared upon our
        arrival at the scheduled location and time or provide us with notice on
        the same day you may be subject to a small missed meeting fee that
        correlates with our hourly rate of $32 USD.
      </p>

      <h6 id="late-payment" class="casetitle">non-payment & late payments</h6>
      <p>All invoices are payable upon receipt.</p>

      <p>
        As mentioned in Time Frames, should a delayed payment cause a project to
        stall for longer than half of the estimated time frame of the project or
        milestone we will archive the project and require a continuation fee to
        resume work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an invoice for web hosting goes unpaid for more than 30 days after
        the invoice has been sent, we reserve the right to suspend your site
        from view until all outstanding bills are paid. We also reserve the
        right to charge interest of up to 12% as allowed by Washington State
        laws on accounts unpaid for more than 30 days.
      </p>

      <h6 id="marketing" class="casetitle">marketing and attribution</h6>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to use your project as an example in our
        promotional material and on our website. At the closing phase of your
        project, we may ask for a quote describing your experience or have you
        fill out a short survey about your experience working with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may ask you to be a reference should any future clients desire to
        speak with people we’ve worked with in the past.
      </p>

      <h6 id="indemnification" class="casetitle">indemnification</h6>
      <p>
        The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless STS DESIGN, LLC, its
        subsidiaries, contractors, employees and affiliates and each of their

        liabilities, penalties, actions, proceedings, judgments, or any and all
        costs thereof (collectively, “Losses”) to which an Indemnified Party may
        become subject and which Losses arise out of, or relate to the

        reimburse an Indemnified Party for all legal and other expenses,
        including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by such Indemnified Party,
        in connection with investigating, defending, or settling any Loss,
        whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in
        which such Indemnified Party is a party.
      </p>

      <h6 id="law-forum" class="casetitle">choice of law and forum</h6>
      <p>
        Any dispute between STS DESIGN, LLC and a customer shall be determined
        by arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association
        pursuant to its commercial arbitration rules. The arbitrator shall
        decide any dispute in accordance with Washington law, without the
        application of choice of law principles. Each party shall bear its own
        expenses and legal fees for the arbitration. The arbitration shall be
        conducted in Spokane County, Washington, unless both parties agree in
        writing to a different location. The arbitration award is enforceable as
        a judgment of any court having proper jurisdiction.

      <h6 id="damages" class="casetitle">limitation of damages or liability</h6>
      <p>

        Notwithstanding anything else in this Master Services Agreement, the
        maximum aggregate liability of STS DESIGN and any of its employees,
