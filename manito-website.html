        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>I felt the need to develop a website because the online resources for Manito Park were lacking cohesion and do not provide a strong experience to those exploring them. <i>SpokaneCity.org</i> has a set of pages detailing Manito Park as well the
          gardens within it, but they are not directly connected through links which makes exploring them inconvenient or confusing. To add to this, the other online resource, <i>ManitoPark.org</i>, is very oudated. I set out to create a website that
          would convey the same type of information that those sites do: history and information about the park.</p>
          <p>I wanted to do a better job detailing the historical significance of the park because it was not thoroughly explored through official online
          channels previously. I developed a lot of my design decisions around the other, similar websites I researched based on what I thought they were lacking and what I thought was successful as well as through interviews and persona development.</p>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="casetitle">of flowers and fountains, part II<br><span>manito park website</span></h6>

    <p>After I completed the Manito Park destination poster and visual identity, I set out to create a website based on those resources. You can view more on those two things <a href="manito.html">here.</a> Currently, Manito Park is lacking an effective
      web presence. What does exist is within the spokanecity.org domain, where information on the park across is spread across multiple pages that aren’t directly linked together. This creates a poor user experience due to the scattered navigation. <i>ManitoPark.org</i>,
      which was originally the primary web resource for the park, is very outdated but is more in line with a traditional website, which is what I believe Manito Park needs. All the important information about Manito Park should be centralized in one
      web resource. With this in mind, I asked myself the question: “what do visitors to the site need and what are they looking for?”</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/SWOTexample.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/SWOTexample.jpg" alt="Manito process: SWOT Analysis Example"></a>
    <p class="byline">Example of SWOT Analysis, Yellowstone Park</p>

    <p>To answer this, I looked back on my research (gathered during the development of the visual identity) and researched the websites of other large or important parks. Specifically, I performed an individual SWOT analysis on each of the following websites:
      Golden Gate Park, Yellowstone Park, and New York’s Central Park. This helped me get an idea of what similar websites were doing well and what they were doing poorly. Additionally, I looked at the current web resources for Manito in order to figure
      out what content should be on my web pages. I then compiled the necessary material, wrote new content, and based my sketches and prototypes around it so that I wouldn’t be designing around “lorem ipsum” placeholder text.</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/wireframe.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/wireframe.jpg" alt="Manito process: SWOT Analysis Example"></a>
    <p class="byline">Landing Page Content Wireframe</p>

    <p>Before I began sketching, I created a basic content-focused wireframe in order to figure out what content should be on each page and what its priority was. This is type of data table that shows the priority of the information on the page and how it
      will be organized. This allows me to lay out the content of the website without regard for its aesthetics. This is a function over form approach to designing a website. I created a unique wireframe for each template that would be on the website.
      I then began sketching around the content order presented in these wireframes, focused more on the visual aspect of the site and its overall presentation. I used a color-coded sketching style in order to help me see how my interactive and visual
      elements were distributed across the page.</p>

    <p>Blue = Notes<br> Green = SVGs and purely visual elements<br> Red = Action Points (such as buttons)<br> Black = Mark<br>
    </p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/sketches.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/sketches.jpg" alt="Manito process: Sketch Examples One"></a>
    <a href="img/manitosite/sketches2.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/sketches2.jpg" alt="Manito process: Sketch Examples Two"></a>
    <p class="byline">Sketchbook Excerpts</p>

    <p>I sketched out numerous ideas and layouts for each template and imagined how I could implement them. I didn’t want to sketch something that would be too complex for the scale of the project. After creating a large series of sketches, I moved back
      to the digital realm and started creating mockups of my layouts in Adobe XD. This was to help me get a better idea of how the site’s interactive elements work without spending the time necessary to code a layout that might need massive adjustments
      down the line. This turned out to be a great thing because I eventually found myself unhappy with the layout that I had established in the prototype and went back to sketching on paper. This time, I tried to push my creativity a lot more and come
      up with some challenging or unique layouts in order to give myself a set of complex ideas to draw from. Ideas can always be simplified or stripped back later. After this phase of sketching, I was ready to move on to the build phase because I was
      happy with my interactive elements.</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/prototype.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/prototype.jpg" alt="Manito process: Prototype"></a>
    <p class="byline">Prototype Screenshot</p>

    <p>For this project I used the CSS framework UI Kit because it was a small enough scale project that I felt that I could do most of the styling and coding necessary myself. I then started developing each “organism” that would be implemented on the landing
      page: the navigation menu, the header, the map of the park, the grid that would be used to present information and imagery, the links and buttons, and finally the page footer. The overall layout is traditional for ease of use. I then began to develop
      a basic style sheet (using Sass) that would establish my primary colors, typefaces, font sizes, etc. I referred to my identity standards guide for these decisions. I then stitched together each individual piece to create the landing page.</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/mymaps.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/mymaps.jpg" alt="Manito process: MyMaps Screenshot"></a>
    <p class="byline">MyMaps Element Screenshot</p>

    <p>I used the Google MyMaps service to create the interactive map because it is responsive and scalable. Visitors to the website are also able to save the map itself to their Google account, which gives it more viewing flexibility than a static image.
      Providing visitors with a digital park map is preferable because it reduces overhead for the park administration and prevents waste (compared to a printed map). The current Manito Park webpage implements a MyMaps element as well, but for mine I
      implemented my logomarks for the location icons, adjusted some of the content, and added images.</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/mymaps2.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/mymaps2.jpg" alt="Manito process: MyMaps Creation Screenshot"></a>
    <p class="byline">MyMaps Creation Screenshot</p>

    <p>Each subsection of the website is dedicated to a specific garden within the park and contains relevant information and imagery. This was a great opportunity to utilize the logos I created for each section of the park and expand on the written content
      that exists on other websites. I incorporated much more information on the history of the park than currently exists on many official channels. I had already dictated the organization of the content on these pages in my content-wireframes and sketched
      them, so they didn’t take long to develop.</p>

    <p>After creating the first full build of the website I sought out testing and feedback from both potential users as well as fellow designers. I carefully recorded their feedback as well as oddities in how the webpages displayed on different devices
      and browsers. With this feedback I then went back and worked on refining the content and general usability of the website with more knowledge of what my testers liked. Unsurprisingly, I found that none of my testers interacted with the content carousels
      that I had placed on the landing page and in some of the subpages, so I removed them and found better methods of displaying their content or removed it entirely.</p>

    <p>After I had the website layout complete, I added the finishing touch to the project by going out and taking my own photographs of the park for the website. I would have done this at the beginning of the project, but I started working on the site in
      the winter before any flowers were blooming. That isn’t the most ideal time to photograph the graph.</p>

    <a href="img/manitosite/mymaps2.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img class="lazy" data-src="img/manitosite/mymaps2.jpg" alt="Manito process: Photograph Contact Sheet"></a>
    <p class="byline">Photography Contact Sheet</p>

    <p>Overall, I believe that the website solves many of the issues present in the old park website and serves the purpose of keeping all the park’s information in one place. If I were to add on to the project, I would incorporate the content and information
      from the Friends of Manito website into the main domain because of how important they are to the existence of the park itself. This would also help raise awareness of their contributions to the community Sadly, I wasn’t even aware that Friends of
      Manito had a website until I had completed this project. This website challenged me and helped me develop my web design skills, but more importantly it helped me test and refine my user experience design process. This aspect of the Manito Park project
      was developed on my own accord under my own direction, so it was important for me to develop and stick to a process in order to produce good results.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading. Maybe go visit Manito Park now that you’re done. It’s nice all year, even if it isn’t photogenic.</p>
