        <h6>insights</h6>
        <p>Manito Park’s current visual identity is unclear and lacks direction. This new identity is intended to create a more artistic and stylish feeling through the use of organic lines, hand drawn art, and vibrant colors. This needed to be done while
          also communicating the historical importance of the park to the Spokane area. The printed materials were created with the budget of Spokane Parks and Recreation, as a result all of the materials can be printed on tabloid size (11” x 17”) paper
          or smaller. The illustrations were intended to appeal to a young adult audience new to the area becuase I found that those who grew up and around Spokane already had some kind of connection with the park. The logomarks for the park were created
          to be stylistically consistent with each other and colorful. The main logo was designed with six “petals,” each one representing one of the main sections. Each of these sections (called subsets) has a its own logomark, each of which was designed
          to reflect the flora and fauna of the area it represents in some way. <br /><br /> The destination poster went through two major iterations; the first was a completely hand drawn with complementary color scheme of red and green. I eventually
          decided against this and decided to go with a more diverse color palette because I felt it would better represent the park as a whole. The original composition also isolated each section of the park into its own “comic book frame,” and after
          wandering the park again in my preparation to re-visit the project I decided that creating a more seamless composition would be more appropriate for the park because that is how it is experiences.</p>
