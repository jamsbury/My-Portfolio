    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>mellc landing page</h4>
        <p>
          a landing page i was hired to create for mandaree enterprises that links to several of their other websites. the page is mostly a recreation of their previous landing page that had to be taken down because of security issues.
        </p>
        <!-- will link eventually or replace item -->

        <h4>lodger google doodle</h4>
        <p>
          a page i made in order to practice css animations. it's an animated recreation of the album cover for david bowie's "lodger" with several little touches to differentiate it from the original image.

        <h4>various illustrations</h4>
        <p>
          various illustrations i've made for several projects, i prefer to avoid illustrations that look like they've been made on a computer and try to incorporate some "organic" energy into my work.
