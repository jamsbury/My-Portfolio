          <p>
            The audience needs both information and a way to register for
            driving courses. The website includes information on the process of
            getting a license as both an adult and a teen, testing requirements,
            as well as information on the courses offered by ABC Driving School
            and Testing Center.

      <p>
        This project began with the client, ABC Driving School, requesting a new
        website to coincide with the launch of their second location. Their
        previous website had served them well for 5 years, but they were looking
        to update their online presence and introduce more information onto the
        website while also making it easier for visitors to access important
        resources. In addition, they sought to create a more distinguished
        visual identity for themselves.
      </p>
      <a href="img/abcdrivingwa/old-home.jpg" data-featherlight="image">
        <img
          class="lazy"
          data-src="img/abcdrivingwa/old-home.jpg"
          alt="The old homepage of ABC Driving School"
        />
      </a>
      <p class="byline">The old homepage of ABC Driving School.</p>

      <p>
        Their previous website also had limited mobile responsiveness, a serious
        issue when the site is going to be viewed by a large amount of high
        school aged visitors. With the goals of the project established, I
        started working on stylescapes to help establish a new visual direction
        for ABC Driving School.

          data-src="img/abcdrivingwa/mobile-example-banner.jpg"
          alt="Mobile version of the old website's homepage."

        A stylescape is a process document popularized by Chris Do of The Futur
        (sic). A stylescape is essentailly a collection of visual elements,
        textures, and colors that help define a visual direction for a project.
        It serves as a way to get both the designers and the clients of a
        project on the same page before anything is set in stone. It is a useful
        document that can save a lot of time over the course of a project.
      </p>
      <a href="img/abcdrivingwa/stylescape.jpg" data-featherlight="image">
        <img
          class="lazy"
          data-src="img/abcdrivingwa/stylescape.jpg"
          alt="Chosen stylescape"
        />
      </a>
      <p class="byline">
        The stylescape chosen by the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stylescape above was one of two proposed to ABC Driving School. They
        liked the sleek angles of this visual direction and decided that the
        color pallete would help them differentiate themselves from other
        services in the surrounding area. With the visuals decided, I began
        creating the website with photos taken by the client (this project was
        performed remotely, I never met the client in person).
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with the client to decide the content hierarchy, some of which
        was inherited from their previous website, and develop new ways to
        present and organize information on the website. In addition, I
        implemented an in-page link to the Acuity Scheduling service that they
        were previously using to organize class registration and process
        payments. This meant that they did not have to change any of their
        existing process to facilitate the new website. <br /><br />

        After the completetion and launch of the website, the staff of ABC
        Driving School expressed their satisfaction with the project and said
        that it helped them feel more confident with the online presence of
        their business. Looking back on the project, I think it went very
        smoothly and allowed me to expand on the vision that the client had for
        their website while also making it easier to access the vital
        information that visitors might need there.
